## Environmental Health Burden in Dublin

This project estimates the population-level health burden from environmental exposures at the small area in Dublin, Ireland ‚Äî specifically road traffic noise and air pollution (PM2.5, NO‚ÇÇ, and O<sub>3</sub>). Using publicly available spatial datasets and risk models from the World Health Organization ([WHO, 2022](https://www.eionet.europa.eu/etcs/etc-he/products/etc-he-products/etc-he-reports/etc-he-report-2022-10-health-risk-assessment-of-air-pollution-and-the-impact-of-the-new-who-guidelines/@@download/file/ETC%20HE%202022-10_Eionet_report_HRA_FINAL_28-11-2022.pdf)) and existing academic work ([Hanigan et al. 2019](https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12942-019-0184-x)), this analysis calculates the fraction of mortality burden attributable to noise and air pollution across different health outcomes. It also includes pre-calculated values for access to health 'benefits', including GP and green space accessibility, which are combined with the health burdens callated to create a holistic 'Health Rating Index' (HRI). The HRI is then used as a dependent variable in a 'spatial' random forest model to understand its relationship to social deprivation, non-auto commuting, population density, distance to the nearest primary and secondary road, and various neighbourhood dummies. For more detail on the methodology, please reference the conference paper below.

The core outputs include:
- Population-weighted exposure assessments at small area level
- Attributable fractions or odds ratios by cause
- Transparent, reproducible code using R

This tool is intended to support public health and urban policy decision-making by quantifying the health impacts of environmental exposures in a local context.
